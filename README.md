**Calculator Project**
A simple and functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates basic front-end development skills by creating an interactive and
responsive calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

**Features**
User-friendly interface.

Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear button to reset the calculations.

Responsive design for various screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**
**HTML**: Structure of the calculator.

**CSS**: Styling for the layout and design.

**JavaScript**: Functional logic to handle user input and perform calculations.

**Usage**
Clone this repository to your local machine:

**bash**
git clone https://github.com/RiyanshuSingh72/Calculator-Project.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser to use the calculator.

**File Structure**
index.html: Contains the structure of the calculator.

styles.css: Defines the styles for the calculator's layout and design.

script.js: Implements the logic for arithmetic operations and user interactions.

**How It Works**
Users can input numbers using the provided buttons.

Operations are selected using the operator buttons.

Clicking the equal-to button (=) evaluates the expression and displays the result.

The clear button resets the current input, operator, and display.

**Future Enhancements**
Add additional features like percentage calculation or a square root function.

Improve the design with animations or enhanced styling.

Extend functionality to handle more complex operations.
